# Bareops file extension
[//]: # (Decision record template by Michael Nygard)

## Status
[//]: # (What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?)
accepted

## Context
[//]: # (What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?)
When writing tasks to use with bareops, one needs to save them to a file.
To easily recognize bareops files, we should come up with a fitting
file extension.

## Decision
[//]: # (What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?)
We decide to use `.bl` as the extension for our task files

## Consequences
[//]: # (What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?)
